# Transformation-technique

## Why Transformation of Features Are Required?

Linear Regression---Gradient Descent ----Global Minima Algorithms like KNN,K Means,Hierarichal Clustering--- Eucledian Distance Every Point has some vectors and Directiom

Deep Learning Techniques(Standardization, Scaling) 1.ANN--->GLobal Minima, Gradient 2.CNN 3.RNN

Types Of Transformation

* Normalization And Standardization
* Scaling to Minimum And Maximum values
* Scaling To Median And Quantiles
* Guassian Transformation (Logarithmic Transformation Reciprocal Trnasformation Square Root Transformation Exponential Trnasformation Box Cox Transformation)
